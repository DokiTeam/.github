### What the hell is Doki?

**Doki** (*Special effects, usually for love situations or when scared*) **is an application for Android 5.0+ devices. We can use it to read content available on the internet, including: Comic, Hentai, Doujinshi,... with many interesting features.**

### Our works

With **Doki**, we want to prioritize bringing a convenient, fast and smooth experience to users. Inheriting from the previous success, we will continue to develop these project and prolong its stability as well as expand the compatibility plan to more older devices.

### Hold on! Where's Doki?

Well, we have officially moved to 夢見 [Project], you can find us [here](https://github.com/YumemiProject) (for source code). Thanks to [Jerry](https://github.com/JeremyChoco) for continuing to develop 夢見 [Project] (based on Doki source code). Also thanks to the [Yaka Team](https://github.com/YakaTeam/) for helping us release that app (created, developed by Koma~~ - Sorry, we have to censor that real name), and [Draken](https://github.com/dragonx943) for creating Doki application.
